#Neopixels and microbit

Here is the code examples and materials list for using the microbits with strips of neopixel.

##Materials
Each microbit will need to have:
  -power source (either usb via computer, power bank or 2 pin 3V battery pack) 
  -Edge connector breakout board
  -8 pixel strip of neopixel, with presoldered wires.  
  
If you are wiring the any strips longer than this, you will need to connect the ground and +5v pins from the strip to an external 5V power supply.
